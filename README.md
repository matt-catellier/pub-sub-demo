# pub-sub demo #

Repo set up for me to try out different implentations of pub-sub, using Event Sourcing and CQRS.  Each 'version' is s different implemtation.  Ideally would have as a provite repo and local consultants can post thier various apporaches.

### STEPS ###
1. install node 
2. git clone https://github.com/matt-catellier/pub-sub-demo.git
3. cd pub-sub/v1 (or v2 etc.)
4. npm install (to get dependacies)
4. node program or node server (to run script using node)
